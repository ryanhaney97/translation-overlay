# Translation Overlay

An overlay for translating (or "subtitling") games. Currently very in-dev.

## Usage

If you want to compile the source code, install leiningen and use that on the project.

Note that it currently does not work on OSX, and is untested for Linux. The differences in handling windows are making it a pain to work with.

## Changelog

Version 0.0.1 - Initial Commit. Currently displays the word "On!" when the 'c' key is pressed. Should even work when window is not in focus, which technically should be all the time. Using "jnativehook" for handling unfocused key presses.
